# 👋 Hi, I’m @Reeves004
Just your average person trying to survive the semester while pretending to have their life together. 
-  I’m interested in things that make my brain hurt in a good way. Cybersecurity, tech, and anything that involves more problems than solutions.
-  Currently learning how to manage my time like a responsible adult (spoiler: it’s mostly procrastination). Also exploring cybersecurity, because who wouldn’t want to be a digital watchman(or watchwoman if that ezists lol?)
-  Looking to collaborate on projects that make my brain ache. If you need someone to question everything and somehow still come up with something halfway decent, I’m your person.
-  Fun fact: I once tried to write a research paper and ended up making a mental list of everything I’d rather be doing. Spoiler: Writing the paper didn’t make it to the list.
